# Notes
* List will keep the order and tuples are not guaranty
* List and tuples can be called on with [] and the number, example x[0], same can be done with a set but outcome would change as their is no order
* Use ```is``` is used to check if elements is the same ***(memory information are the same)***
* try to control the user input when you can use ```.lower()```
* Can find absolute value ```.abs()```
* Your wont be able to call a value in a key-pair by a number like in a list
