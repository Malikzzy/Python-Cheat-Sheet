## testing
* you can use ```assert``` thats built in to check if an acition is true/boolen
* example : ```x=10    assert x ==2``` this will give you a ```AssertionError```, which can be use in a try/except

## pytest 
* 3rd party libary that allows you to perform unit testing
* ```pip install pytest```
* run ```pytest``` from the terminal 


## Extra 
* Unit testing is testing fuctions within your program
* best practice to name the fuction your testing test_thenameofthefunction. Exmaple ```def app()  def test_app()```
