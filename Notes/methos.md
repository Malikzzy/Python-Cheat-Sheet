## Removed Whitespace from S
*.strip
Eample ```name = Malik   Rubio``` you can use ```name=name.strip()```
.split()
.title()
.strip()
[] brackets in code doucmentation means the paramater is optional 
.round()
You can use ```:``` within the a format string aka a F string to to place a charater with in the output of the string. 
For example you can use ```x =1000 print(f"{x:,}")``` to get the output of ```1,000```
For floting point you can also use ``.2f`` within the formart of the f-string. This will round the diget by 2. 
Example ```x = .77788``` ```print(f"{x:.2f}")``` output will be ```.77```
## Creating a function 
* first defined the the new fuction by using ```def```
* Full example looks like
* ``` def hello(): print("hello")```
* Then then the pass a pramater but aslo to set defult paramater
* Example ```def hello(to=world): print(f"Hello {to}")```
* The defult output will be ```Hello world``` but if you do ```x=Malik hello(x)``` Output will be ```Hello Malik```
